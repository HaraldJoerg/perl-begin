* Add some screenshots to the /uses/games page.

* Pick up a better gvim colour scheme for the example code in the
perl-for-newbies lecture.

* Syntax-highlight the examples in the other code excerpts in the site
(especially the src/tutorials/bad-elements/ ).

* Add http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Main_Page .

* Further work on src/uses/chat-scripting/index.html.wml .
    - Maybe trim the introduction.

* Maybe a page on «What's next "after" perl?».
