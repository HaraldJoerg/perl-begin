* Add screenshots to the IDEs page and other relevant pages.

* Add to the page about best practices:
    - refactoring:
        - duplicate code.
        - long functions and methods.
    - EEK 
        - pass items from one subroutine to another.
            - use objects.
            - assign them to slots.
    - Law of Demeter
    - Mixing tabs and spaces.
    - Always add an explicit return from the subroutine.
        - <<return 0;>> instead of <<return;>>
    - leading underscores ("_") for non-API methods and functions.
    - print {$fh} @args instead of "print $fh @args" which is too easy to miss.
    - varvarname - using a variable as a different variable's name.
    - http://www.stonehenge.com/merlyn/UnixReview/col52.html
        - $object->new() to create a new instance.
    - avoid using perlform - use Perl6::Form instead (also see the text
    generation page).
    - C-style for loops.
    - Always label your loops.
    - Accessing the last element using $array[$#array] - use $array[-1]
    instead.
    - modifying an array/hash while iterating over it.
    - qx/`....` instead of system().
        - also open.
    - comments and identifiers in a foreign language. 
    - STDIN instead of ARGV.

* Link to Fomberg's Hebrew with Perl site.

* Revamp the Testimonials on the pages.

* Add a section about graphical debugger front-ends.

* Add a page about modules.

Long Term:

    - Learning Perl
    - Beginning Perl
    - Project Euler
    - 99 Problems in Lisp
    - Perl Quiz-of-the-Week
