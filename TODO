* Pick up a better gvim colour scheme for the example code in the
perl-for-newbies lecture.

* Syntaxhighlight the examples in the other code excerpts in the site (especially
the src/tutorials/bad-elements/ ).

* Page about bad elements:
    - declaring all variables at the top of the file, instead of when they
    are first used, and in the innermost scope.
