* Add Perl-Monks to more relevant pages.

* Add screenshots to the IDEs page and other relevant pages.

* Page about Text Generation:
    - Text::Table.
    - string concatenation: .=, ., join, map, sort, grep, List::Util,
    List::MoreUtils, List::By.
    - interpolation.
    - <tm604> rindolf: yes, maybe an example showing $string, $array[$idx] and
      $hash{key} since it's not immediately obvious what's allowed in
      interpolation, especially if you come from a different language.

* Add to the page about best practices:
    - split the code into paragraphs with empty lines.
    - discuss commenting.
    - IO::Socket instead of lower-level socket/Socket.pm/etc. calls.
    - chop instead of chomp.
        - handling \r\n on Unix.

* Add a page about optimizing / profiling / etc.

* Add a page about E-mail-handling.

* OO Programming Section:
    - maybe add the list of OO modules I composed.

* Fix the site-resources/ Web Forum detail.

* Link to Fomberg's Hebrew with Perl site.

* Revamp the Testimonials on the pages.

* Add a section about graphical debugger front-ends.

* Add a page explaining about Perl 6.
    - New language.
        - Not compatible
    - Is it still Perl?
    - Perl 5 and CPAN derive inspiration from it.
    - This site focuses on Perl 5.

Long Term:
----------

* Link to Perl/Qt once it's ready.
