* Add Perl-Monks to more relevant pages.

* Add screenshots to the IDEs page and other relevant pages.

* Page about Text Generation:
    - Text::Table.
    - string concatenation: .=, ., join, map, sort, grep, List::Util,
    List::MoreUtils, List::By.
    - interpolation.
    - <tm604> rindolf: yes, maybe an example showing $string, $array[$idx] and
      $hash{key} since it's not immediately obvious what's allowed in
      interpolation, especially if you come from a different language.

* Add a page about best practices / the usual stuff to avoid / modern
Perl / "how to write Perl and not make the experts angry" :

    - <perlbot> rindolf: use strict; use warnings; use lexical filehandles
      instead of globals (open my $tmp ..vs.. open TMP), use three argument
      form of open, don't use prototypes unless you really want to. don't call
      subs with & unless it's required (&sub() ..vs.. sub()). check for errors
      (open (); ..vs..  open() or die $!)

* Add a page about optimizing / profiling / etc.

* Add a page about E-mail-handling.

* OO Programming Section:
    - maybe add the list of OO modules I composed.

* Fix the site-resources/ Web Forum detail.

* Link to Fomberg's Hebrew with Perl site.

* Revamp the Testimonials on the pages.

* Add a section about graphical debugger front-ends.

* Add a page explaining about Perl 6.
    - New language.
        - Not compatible
    - Is it still Perl?
    - Perl 5 and CPAN derive inspiration from it.
    - This site focuses on Perl 5.

Long Term:
----------

* Link to Perl/Qt once it's ready.
