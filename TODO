* Add Perl-Monks to more relevant pages.

* Add screenshots to the IDEs page and other relevant pages.

* Page about Text Generation:
    - Text::Table.
    - string concatenation: .=, ., join, map, sort, grep, List::Util,
    List::MoreUtils, List::By.
    - interpolation.
    - <tm604> rindolf: yes, maybe an example showing $string, $array[$idx] and
      $hash{key} since it's not immediately obvious what's allowed in
      interpolation, especially if you come from a different language.

* Add to the page about best practices:
    - discuss commenting.
    - chop instead of chomp.
        - handling \r\n on Unix.
    - refactoring:
        - magic numbers.
        - duplicate code.
        - long functions and methods.
    - accessing object slots directly
        - use accessors.
    - EEK 
        - pass items from one subroutine to another.
            - use objects.
            - assign them to slots.
    - ^ and $ in regexes.
        - ambiguous.
        - better use \A and \z to mean start-of-string and end-of-string.
        - with /m can be used for start-of-line / end-of-line.
    - Law of Demeter
    - Mixing tabs and spaces.
    - Always add an explicit return from the subroutine.
    - leading underscores ("_") for non-API methods and functions.
    - print {$fh} @args instead of "print $fh @args" which is too easy to miss.
    - varvarname - using a variable as a different variable's name.

* Add a page about optimizing / profiling / etc.

* Add a page about E-mail-handling.

* OO Programming Section:
    - maybe add the list of OO modules I composed.

* Fix the site-resources/ Web Forum detail.

* Link to Fomberg's Hebrew with Perl site.

* Revamp the Testimonials on the pages.

* Add a section about graphical debugger front-ends.

* Add a page explaining about Perl 6.
    - New language.
        - Not compatible
    - Is it still Perl?
    - Perl 5 and CPAN derive inspiration from it.
    - This site focuses on Perl 5.

Long Term:
----------

* Link to Perl/Qt once it's ready.
