* Add Perl-Monks to more relevant pages.

* Add screenshots to the IDEs page and other relevant pages.

* Add to the page about best practices:
    - refactoring:
        - duplicate code.
        - long functions and methods.
    - EEK 
        - pass items from one subroutine to another.
            - use objects.
            - assign them to slots.
    - Law of Demeter
    - Mixing tabs and spaces.
    - Always add an explicit return from the subroutine.
        - <<return 0;>> instead of <<return;>>
    - leading underscores ("_") for non-API methods and functions.
    - print {$fh} @args instead of "print $fh @args" which is too easy to miss.
    - varvarname - using a variable as a different variable's name.
    - http://www.stonehenge.com/merlyn/UnixReview/col52.html
        - $object->new() to create a new instance.
    - avoid using perlform - use Perl6::Form instead (also see the text
    generation page).
    - don't overuse $_ - it's prune to errors.
    - C-style for loops.
    - Always label your loops.
    - Accessing the last element using $array[$#array] - use $array[-1]
    instead.
    - Array element: @array[$idx] instead of $array[$idx].
    - modifying an array/hash while iterating over it.
    - qx/`....` instead of system().
        - also open.
    - last/next/redo/etc. without explicit LABELs.
    - using $a and $b as variable names.
    - comments and identifiers in a foreign language. 
    - STDIN instead of ARGV.
    - abuse of $#array (like $#array + 1 for array length).

* Add a page about optimizing / profiling / etc.

* Add a page about E-mail-handling.

* OO Programming Section:
    - maybe add the list of OO modules I composed.

* Fix the site-resources/ Web Forum detail.

* Link to Fomberg's Hebrew with Perl site.

* Revamp the Testimonials on the pages.

* Add a section about graphical debugger front-ends.

* Add a page explaining about Perl 6.
    - New language.
        - Not compatible
    - Is it still Perl?
    - Perl 5 and CPAN derive inspiration from it.
    - This site focuses on Perl 5.

* Add a page about modules.

* Add a page about ssh/telnet.

Long Term:
----------

* Link to Perl/Qt once it's ready.

* Add a page with exercises/challenges:
    - Learning Perl
    - Beginning Perl
    - Project Euler
    - 99 Problems in Lisp
    - Perl Quiz-of-the-Week
