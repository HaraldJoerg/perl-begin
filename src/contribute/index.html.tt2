<p>
We feel that the Perl Beginners' Site should be a community site
instead of a centralized "Cathedral"-like site. Thus, the entire source
code is available online and contributions from outsiders are welcome.
There is a <a href="list/">list of contributors</a>, so make sure
your name appears there as soon as possible.
</p>

<p>
Here are some ways in which you can contribute to the site:
</p>

[% WRAPPER h2_section id = "publicise" title = "Publicise the Site" %]

<p>
You can publicise the Perl Beginners Site or individual pages thereof by
posting or upvoting it in social-bookmarking sites, social networking sites,
recommending it to your friends online and offline, or linking to it from your
web-site or blog. You can use the "Add-to-any" button at the bottom of the
pages to post it on various sites.
