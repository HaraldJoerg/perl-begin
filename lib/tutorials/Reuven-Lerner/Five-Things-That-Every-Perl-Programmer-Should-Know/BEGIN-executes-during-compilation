<p>We can solve our <code>if</code>-<code>use</code> problem by defining a
subroutine that's not only defined at compile time, but also executes
at compile time: <code>BEGIN</code>.</p>

<pre>
BEGIN {
    if ($] >= 5.006)
    {
	use warnings;
    }
}
</pre>

<p>Note that we don't have to say <code>sub BEGIN</code>.

<p>You can put anything you want in a <code>BEGIN</code>.  Heck, you could
put your whole program in a <code>BEGIN</code>!  But don't do that.
Please.</p>
