<ul>
    <li> <code>use strict</code> is your friend.
    <li> Don't use globals outside of a package.
    <li> Don't try to use packages with lexicals...
    <li> ... unless you want to do cool things like singletons
    <li> Don't call "lexical" variables "local" variables
    <li> Use lexicals everywhere you can...
    <li> ... and especially in subroutines
    <li> Don't use <code>local</code> until and unless you read MJD's
    article (and understand it)
    <li> Namespace pollution? Exporting?  It works great, but can be
    confusing at first.  Learn <code>@EXPORT</code>, <code>@EXPORT_OK</code>,
    and <code>%EXPORT_TAGS</code> well before you use them
</ul>
