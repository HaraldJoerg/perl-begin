* Create a macro for a link to a CPAN distribution
(http://search.cpan.org/dist/MyDist-Here/), a self link (with MyDist-Here as 
the contents), and a perldoc?MyModule::Here link.

* Put the TODO and DONE on the web-site so people will be able to view
them and contribute.

* Page about Bad Elements:
    - discuss commenting.
    - accessing object slots directly
        - use accessors.

        - The Ancient Perl pages on the Perl 5 Wiki.
        - chromatic's Modern Perl book.
        - advice given by people on Freenode's #perl and on the Perl beginners
    - ^ and $ in regexes.
        - ambiguous.
        - better use \A and \z to mean start-of-string and end-of-string.
        - with /m can be used for start-of-line / end-of-line.

    - refactoring:
        - magic numbers.
